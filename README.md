CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Deep Learning
This project implements an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning and computer vision. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 distinct classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can accurately classify unseen images into one of the 10 categories. The model is trained using open-source deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
